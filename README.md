## Overview

This repository contains a project of mine the `QHScompiler` which compiles my own esoteric programming language called `QHS`.

## Usage

To use the `QHScompiler`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the build directory:
    ```sh
    cd QHSCompiler/build
    ```
2. Generate Makefile using CMake (make sure you have CMake installed):

    cmake ..
    ```

3. Execute the Makefile:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

4. Run the compiler help for more information on how to use it:
    ```sh
    ./QHScompiler --help
    ```
